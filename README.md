> My name is Johnny (White Lights) and I'm a full stack engineer, creative technologist, and computer artist.

> I specialize in glitchy shaders, weird smart contracts, and beautiful full-stack apps. Whether it's React, Vue, Electron, TypeScript, Node, Solidity, Python, SQL, Postgres, GLSL, CI/CD, AWS, Digital Ocean, Heroku, Cloud Ops, or Dev Ops, you can bet I've done it. I also consider myself quite good with AI.
